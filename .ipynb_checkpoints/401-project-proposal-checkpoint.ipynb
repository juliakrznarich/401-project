    "\n",
    "This project explores the biochemical domain of protein structure and function, an area I'm passionate about as a biochemistry student. Understanding how mutations impact protein behavior is fundamental to comprehending disease, developing therapies, and engineering novel proteins.  Computation, particularly molecular dynamics simulations, is crucial in this field, providing atomic-level insights often inaccessible through experiments.  Using OpenMM on a GPU-equipped high-performance computing cluster, this project will benchmark and aim to accelerate the simulation of both wild-type myoglobin and its H64Q mutant, focusing on comparing their dynamics to understand how this specific mutation affects oxygen binding.  Success will be defined by the efficient parallel simulation of both variants, providing a deeper understanding of myoglobin's function and showcasing the power of OpenMM and GPUs in biochemical research."

    "### Part 1 Software Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "For the software exploration milestone, I will focus on OpenMM, a high-performance toolkit for molecular dynamics simulations. OpenMM's strength lies in its ability to efficiently simulate complex biomolecular systems, making it ideal for studying protein dynamics and interactions.  Its Python interface simplifies the process of setting up, running, and analyzing simulations, while its support for GPUs allows for significant performance gains.  My exploration will begin with the official OpenMM documentation (http://docs.openmm.org/latest/), which provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and examples.  I will also refer to published research articles that have utilized OpenMM to understand its practical applications and best practices.  Specifically, I'll investigate how to set up a protein system (myoglobin in this case), including adding solvent, defining force fields, and setting simulation parameters.  I'll explore different integration algorithms and how to analyze simulation trajectories to extract meaningful data.  The outcome of this step will be a detailed tutorial document, targeted at my peers, demonstrating how to install and use OpenMM on the HPC. This document will include step-by-step instructions for setting up a myoglobin simulation, running it on the HPC cluster, and analyzing the results.  I aim to create a self-contained tutorial, including example scripts and necessary input files, bundled in a format compatible with getexample (or similar HPC resource sharing mechanisms) so that others can easily reproduce the simulation.

    "### Part 2 Benchmark and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark will focus on the computationally intensive parts of the myoglobin simulation, primarily the nonbonded force calculations and the integration step, as these consume the most simulation time.  While OpenMM itself has built-in parallelization capabilities for both CPUs and GPUs, the effective utilization of this parallelism is the key target for optimization.  Specifically, the benchmark will measure the time spent in the nonbonded force calculation routines (exploring different methods like PME and their parameters), the integration step (focusing on parallel execution of the chosen algorithm), and, if using GPUs, the time spent on CPU-GPU data transfers and kernel launch overhead.  Optimization efforts will concentrate on maximizing GPU utilization by minimizing explicit data transfers between CPU and GPU, tuning OpenMM's internal parallel execution parameters (threads per block, etc.), and potentially exploring different nonbonded force calculation parameters.  Success will be evaluated by measuring the simulation throughput (ns/day) and comparing the optimized code's performance against a baseline OpenMM script.  The goal is a significant speedup, ideally a factor of 2-4x or more, primarily through improved GPU utilization and parallel execution efficiency.  The final report will detail the benchmark problem (myoglobin simulation), optimization strategies, benchmark results (graphs, tables), analysis of speedup factors, limitations, and future work.  A successful outcome will demonstrate how targeted optimization of computationally intensive kernels and efficient parallel execution can significantly improve OpenMM simulation performance, enabling more efficient exploration of larger systems or longer timescales."
